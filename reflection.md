- What are your initial impressions of Java? 

It's not as different from Python as I thought it was going to be. It wasn't horribly hard to adapt to after doing it for a little.

- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 

I can tell that most programming languages have similar elements like all have conditional statements and loops but there are different ways to do them in different languages.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

It was hard to figure out where to start and how to do the mirrored responses but TA hours really helped with that. I would tell someone to go to TA hours and talk about the assignment with the TA and your peers because it's a lot more helfpul than doing the assignment by yourself. I couldn't figure out how to handle punctuation and capitalization for mirrored words or the you --> me/I issue but that's okay.
